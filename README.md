## Description

My motivation was to learn how to use programming languages to build a website. I want to be able to use this skills for voluntary organisations I am involved with who have to up their game in their web presentation. I have now understood better how code works and am encouraged to learn more. I learned how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript language to code websites and know now what they are responsible for in the whole picture.
